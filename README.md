# 🌍 Improved Inchling Origin 🌍

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

**Icon**: Spider Eye\
**Impact**: 🔴🔴🔴\
**Description**: Tiny and agile, Inchlings navigate the world with unmatched stealth and vertical prowess. Their delicate frame and unique metabolism offer both advantages and challenges. From effortlessly evading nature's obstacles to experiencing intense sugar rushes, Inchlings tread a fine line between nimble advantages and vulnerable limitations.

*Positive* 🟢:
- **Inchling Ascendancy**: Drawing from their innate connection to the tiniest crevices and surfaces, Inchlings have evolved a swift and seamless climbing technique which allows them to glide up vertical terrains with the grace and speed of a wall runner. (Primary)
- **Delicate Dodger**: The Inchling's nimble form effortlessly evades nature's prickly defenses. Thorns and brambles pose no threat, and even the stickiest of cobwebs can't hinder their swift movement.
- **Featherlight Glide**: Harnessing the lightweight essence of a feather or the aerodynamic nature of paper, Inchlings can momentarily glide through the air. This allows them to descend gracefully and turning potential falls into controlled flights, ensuring a soft landing every time.
- **Silent Stride**: The Inchling's delicate and lightweight frame grants them the unique ability of moving with such quietness and precision, they become undetectable to Sculk Sensors.

*Neutral* 🟡:
- **Sugar-Fueled Frenzy**: The Inchling's unique metabolism reacts intensely to sugar. Consuming it triggers a powerful "sugar rush", granting them unparalleled speed and enhanced saturation. However, indulging too much or too often in this sweet temptation risks overstimulation, potentially leading to nausea, blurred vision, and rapid hunger depletion.
- **Companion Mounter**: Inchlings can mount and ride other players and entities. Whether seeking a vantage point, swift transport, or simply bonding with allies. (Secondary)
- **Efficient Metabolism**: The Inchling's compact physiology conserves energy with remarkable efficiency, reducing their need for frequent sustenance. However, the exertion of sprinting or swimming, given their size and the greater distances covered, accelerates their hunger, demanding a careful balance of speed and endurance.
- **Minuscule Majesty**: Embodying the essence of diminutive stature, Inchlings have been granted the unique advantage of being the tiniest beings in the realm.
- **Nimble Nature**: The Inchling's delicate frame, while reducing their heart count, gifts them with unmatched agility, allowing for rapid strikes. However, their compact stature demands closer engagements, slightly limiting their combat and building reach. In this balance of vulnerability and speed, the Inchling thrives.

*Negative* 🔴:
- **Burdened Armor**: While Inchlings can don armor, anything heavier than leather weighs them down significantly. This added weight slows their movement.
- **Delicate Swimmer**: Water currents are more challenging for Inchlings due to their lightweight nature; thus, they have more difficulty swimming.
- **Fragile Bones**: The Inchling's tiny frame is more susceptible to damage, making them take an additional 10% damage from all sources.
- **Slow Miner**: Their small stature makes mining slower for Inchlings.
